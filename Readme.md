# SQL-Stats
SQL-Stats is a personal project to assist me in learning statistics. I have chosen to push out this as a project to assist other people along the journey. As when searching, I could not always find examples that were relevant or that would work on my own data set without much re-work.

## Goals
* Learn statistics.
* Help others learn statistics.
* Create simple to use, robust code
* Allow the code to be used in different contexts and on different data / content / tables
* Provide Examples and the formulas for each of the procedures.

## Procedures
### Current
* BoxAndWhisker_Partitioned
* GeneralStats_Partitioned
* KmeanCluster_Partitioned
* Pareto_Partitioned
* TimeBuckets
    * Creates a Calendar daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly bucket (default 2 years)

### Planned
* ConstrainedApportion_Partitioned (Apportion out data based on a total available) 
* Update GeneralStats_Partitioned with additional statistics such as (Regression Line)
* Moving Average Forecast
* Weighted Moving Average Forecast
* Linear Predictor Forecast (Using Regression) 
* Seasonal With Trend Forecast (Using Regression and Average Seasonal Index)
